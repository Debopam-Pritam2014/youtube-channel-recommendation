## Overview
------------

This project aims to develop a content-based YouTube channel recommendation system. The system uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze channel descriptions and recommend similar channels.


## Features
------------

* Content-based filtering using CountVectorizer
* Cosine similarity calculation for recommendation
* Streamlit application for user-friendly interface
* Deployment on Streamlit Cloud


## Technical Requirements
----------------------

* Python 3.8+
* scikit-learn
* Streamlit
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Pickle


## Installation
------------

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Debopam-Pritam2014/youtube-channel-recommendation.git`
2. Create Virtual Environment: `conda create venv python==3.10 -y`
3. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the application: `streamlit run app.py`


## Usage
-----

1. Open the Streamlit application
2. Select a YouTube channel name
3. Click "Recommend" to get similar channel suggestions


## Dataset
---------

* Collected from Kaggle
* Preprocessed and cleaned for analysis


## Model
------

* CountVectorizer for text vectorization
* Cosine similarity calculation for recommendation


## Deployment
-------------

* Deployed on Streamlit Cloud

## Challenges/Limitations
----------------------

### 1. Memory Issues

Calculating the similarity matrix for a large dataset resulted in memory issues. To mitigate this, only Indian YouTube channels were included in the dataset.

### 2. Large Similarity Matrix

The similarity matrix size became approximately 2GB, which posed storage and computation challenges. To address this, a dictionary was created where:

* Keys: Channel indices
* Values: Similar channel indices and similarity scores

This optimization reduced storage requirements and improved computation efficiency.


Future improvements will focus on:


* Scaling the model to accommodate larger datasets
* Exploring alternative similarity calculation methods
* Integrating additional features (e.g., video content analysis)
